# Semantic-Correspondence-Project

Our project is based on Colab. All the codes and results can be found in the file "Semantic_Projrct5NoToken.ipynb", and the datasets(Spair71k\PF-willow\PF-pascal) is saved in my google drive and you can download the necessay files from "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18kP7eIIUHrXAgtU4BBXwxwx5d8fSIM5y?usp=drive_link"

---Dataset and traing models setup---
Before running the notebook, please follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset files (SPair-71k, PF-Pascal, PF-Willow) and models already trained.
2. Create a folder named Project_Semantic in the root of your Google Drive.
3. Upload these files into this folder.
4. Ensure your directory structure looks like this:
My Drive/
└── Project_Semantic/
    ├── SPair-71k.tar.gz
    ├── pf-pascal.zip
    └── pf-willow.zip
    └── Training models/
        ├── dinov2_base_1L.pth
        ├── dinov2_base_2L.pth
        ├── dinov2_base_3L.pth
        └── dinov3_large_1L.pth
5. Everything is done! Do it!
